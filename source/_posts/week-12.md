# The Discovery phase #1


## Researching animations libraries üîç
Vizrt showed a demo of GSAP *(GreenSock Animation Platform)* & Web Animations API and wanted to pursue the last option due to licensing.

We discovered many exciting animation libraries during our research, the most notable being Framer Motion. But as Vizrt were using the frontend framework Vue, and Motion was built for React. We kept searching for alternatives and discovered popmotion, the underlying animation library behind motion and web-animations-js, a JavaScript implementaiton of the Web Animations API

## A structured approach? ü§î
The team was also looking into have some structure during our project work. Typing out a Gantt diagram, waterfall style did not fit our philosphy as we felt it was important to improve & deliver continously. Especially since we did not have a full overview of the scope, and what Vizrt was <ins>really</ins> asking for.

We landed on a Scrumban style leveraging GitHub to the fullest. Having a project board where we put up tasks and delegated them by priority.

## Deciding what tools to use üß∞
The team wanted to get started coding and decided to use the tools Vizrt were using, in this case Vue. We also decided to try using Storybook and the ATOM priniciple in order to create clean code and be able to split up the work within the team.

## Deliverables üì¶
None
