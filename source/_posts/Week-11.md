# The Beginning


## Kick-off!
We started this week with a kick-off for the bachelor project and attended some presentations with helpful information about the process itself and on writing our thesis.

## First meeting with Vizrt
Vizrt invited us to a introductionary meeting with our thesis supervisor Atle, where they the topic and demoed Viz Story & Story Admin. This was our first insight into the media industry, and everything seemed very distant and unfamiliar. This made it challenging for the team to get a grasp of the project scope. But one has to start somewhere!

## First submission
The team delivered our first delivarable, the title of our project **"HTML Graphics"** and had a brainstorming session approaching the topic / issue from different angles to determine the scope and what we were really trying to achieve.
